		<h2><u> The Seventeenth End </u></h2>
		<p>
			Around you, a stunning vista of golden beauty rolls on forever. It almost seems unreal; like the Kingdom of the Sun itself was real. The grass soft like a blanket of lushous linen and a gloriously blue sky to blanket it. Around this sky
			shone almost perfect clouds. The world they had created was truely perfect, the exact idea of a utopia that would never end; yet they would still tarnish it with their own blood and bodies. They would create these creatures of purest
			violence still in a visage of flawless art. On the ground you found a tag too large to be worn by a person. It read 'The Last Mercy'.
