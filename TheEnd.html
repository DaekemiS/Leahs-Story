		<h2><u> The Final End </u></h2>
		<p>
			Upon touching the light; fragments of the ray shatter out into eight pieces, creating a star that converged around you. The grey bird dove beneath the ground in a flurry of feathers and tears. The sounds of the sob echoed around as the
			almost etherial magic surrounds you. As all seemed hopeless and lost, the embodyment of hope herself re-emerged. The woman, from each world you had seen before, had come, with a plethora of allies prepared to fight for all they believed
			was true. <br /> <br />

			From here, a being of utmost despair rose. Their face stained with black tears, a being of deep blues and darkness towering over the platform, the sounds of her agony raining for all as the land rattled and shook. It nearly tore at the seams.
			<br /> And yet she pressed on.

			<br /><br />

			She fought, tooth and claw against this being of purest loss, despair, hopelessness, knowing that she would doom her people to face despair forever. The being, claiming it would free her world from the villainy of hope in death, bringing
			to bare every nightmare, every creature, every molten tear of condensed loss they could to the field. Yet none would be enough.

			<br /><br />
			'It would not be enough.' A familiar voice spoke. As the distinguishable sound of flapping found its way to your side. 'Hope and despair will always be locked in a fight. Despair, unrelenting, but Hope indomitable. To exist, one requires the
			other, and humanity are want to lean too far into a taken side. Be it Hope and Despair, or anything else. Together you will need to fight for what you believe is right. But if one woman can bring to bare the might of eight, then you too
			can face the world that ails you. This is the choice I implore you to make; fight or fall, make it be for the choice you believe true. Hope, or Despair. Future, or present.' Her feathers slowly floated down unto the floor, one gracing your hand...
			<br /> </br>

			Before you awoke.
