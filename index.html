	<div class="main">
		<h2><u> The First Age </u></h2>
		<p>
			It began in a shining light consumed into nothingness. A swirling darkness with naught but a soft, blue bird. She beckons you. Follow. Follow... And as you drift across this vast expanse against your will, she speaks.
			<br /> <br /> 'Were you told the tale of the bluebird? As she flew, through countless stars? I wouldn't have thought so; its a story long forgotten in time, told through countless memories and the feelings of hope and despair:
			It began in a time so far beyond our reckoning, that you could say it started ours. It was a world: full of light, and hope. Of creation, of magic. Etherys.' <br /><br />
			As the bird swept through stars dead and gleaming, the tug of reality pulled you unto this world. Trees blossomsed, creatures bizzare and beautiful roamed the land... and a man. His face burdened with duty as he awaits the return of a loved
			one... Here, you find yourself with a body. You're dressed head to toe in old garbs, seemingly a tender of these creatures. It is... unique, to say the least.
