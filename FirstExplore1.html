		<h2><u> Lost in the Last. </u></h2>
		<p>
			As you rise, the soft, fluttering of the self-same bluebird who led you here falls upon your ears. She dances through the air, shooting off to a building off in the distance. <br /><br />
			Next to it, a tall figure stands forlorn; staring out into the endless expanse above. He is muttering, but that's about all you can make out. After a few moments to gather your barings, you notice your legs have finally ceased shaking
			and you have regained your balance. The only viable option for now would be to follow this bird and be lead unto its future.
